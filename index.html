		<p>Wraith talk. It’s important to use cocoa butter. It’s the key to more success, why not live smooth? Why live rough? Wraith talk. Congratulations, you played yourself. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. Cloth talk. Bless up. I’m up to something. Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success. Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion!</p>
