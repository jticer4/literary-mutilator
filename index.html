		<p id="first">It’s about making placeholder text great again. That’s what people want, they want placeholder text to be great
		again. If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my
		office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. I’m the best thing that ever happened to
		placeholder text.</p>

		<p id="second">We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. The other thing with Lorem
		Ipsum is that you have to take out its family. Does everybody know that pig named Lorem Ipsum? She's a disgusting
			pig, right?</p>

		<p id="third">Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be
		small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT! I was going to say something
		extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice."</p>
